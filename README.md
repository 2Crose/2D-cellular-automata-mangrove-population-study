# 2D-cellular-automata-mangrove-population-study

"""
Welcome to my 2d Cellular Automata for Mangrove Population Dynamics.
In the notes files there are instructions for the code as well as the code without the messy notes.
The success code is for a randomly generated map of Red, Black, White mangroves aswell as Brazillian Peppertree (Yellow).
The zonation code is for a layed map where the same species interact based on overlapping salinity levels.
Items in the codes that can be changed to fit the desired simulation:
Salinity Tolerances
Shade Tolerances
Age Death
Simulation size
Simulation speed
Red Mangrove Growth
Black Mangrove Takeover
Black Mangrove Growth
White Mangrove Takeover
White Mangrove Growth
Yellow (BP) Takeover
Yellow (BP) Growth
Randomized Cell placement
Hurricane Strength
